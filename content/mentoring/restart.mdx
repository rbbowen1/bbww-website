## Introduction

#### Mentorship program geared towards you

This mentoring program is especially geared to Aspiring Professionals
who perceive their efforts to be undervalued. It includes a comprehensive
assessment of the plans, responsibilities and activities that are currently
included in the Professional’s portfolio, a review of how the Professional
is perceived by management and the organization, and the design of
an action plan for jump-starting a personal effectiveness action
plan to garner deserved recognition. Unlimited email contact with
Brayton is included in addition to the 3-sessions of personal
mentoring.
