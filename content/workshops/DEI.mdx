## Introduction

This workshop provides information on the factors that determine how inclusive your organization is as a whole and relative to the diverse segments of a larger community. You will be guided in the process of laying out a step-by-step plan of action to enhance your effectiveness and your reputation as a model of excellence and human equality. You will come to understand how diversity, inclusion, and intersectionality can spawn creativity, innovation, and new wealth and how compassion serves as an elixir for “wholeness.”


## DEI Workshop

<Steps>

  <Step>
  How inclusive is your organization?
  </Step>
Inclusivity is a cornerstone of thriving, innovative organizations. Measuring how inclusive your organization is involves assessing various aspects, from hiring practices and workplace culture to accessibility and equal opportunities.

  <Step>
   To what extent are you aware of systemic biases that may be adversely impacting your objectives for collaboration, cooperation, teamwork, and profitability?
  </Step>
  Understanding the depth of systemic biases is crucial in identifying obstacles that may hinder collaboration, cooperation, teamwork, and profitability. Assessing your awareness of these biases helps to uncover hidden barriers and implement strategies to foster a more inclusive and productive organizational environment.

  <Step>
  Have you taken inventory of the behavioral norms that impede or promote inclusion, innovation, and increased profits?
  </Step>
  Taking stock of behavioral norms is essential in identifying factors that either hinder or support inclusion, innovation, and profitability. By evaluating these norms, organizations can implement targeted changes to cultivate a more inclusive and innovative culture, ultimately driving increased profits.

  <Step>
   Are your organizational culture, structure, and personal behaviors properly aligned to create a system of compassion and “wholeness”?
</Step>
Evaluating whether your organizational culture, structure, and personal behaviors align to create a compassionate and holistic system is crucial for fostering a supportive and productive environment. By aligning these elements, organizations can cultivate a sense of “wholeness,” promoting well-being and enhancing overall performance.
