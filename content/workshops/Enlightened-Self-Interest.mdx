## Introduction

Recognizing and rewarding employees oftentimes is an exercise of “carrots and sticks” for any number of organizations. The reality is that these so-called reward systems do not do what they are intended to do, namely incent workers to perform to desired levels of performance. This is because they lack the fundamental understanding that motivation is an “inside job.”


## Enlightened Self-Interest Workshop

This workshop provides a rigorous analysis of why these systems do not “motivate.” By contrast, a scrupulous review of the “5R’s” for recognizing and rewarding employees will provide a treasure trove of information, as we explore the compassionate aspects of:

✅ Responsibility

✅ Respect

✅ Relationships

✅ Recognition

✅ Reward


Indeed, the 5R’s provide a model of Enlightened Self-Interest that benefits the employee, the organization for which they work, and the customers whom they serve.
