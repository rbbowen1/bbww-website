## Introduction

#### Be the Leader others want to follow

Learn how effective leaders inspire commitment, garner respect, and add value to what they do. By identifying targets for behavioral change, it is possible to increase leadership effectiveness, improve interpersonal relations, develop hidden potential, and identify development gaps which, when closed, can dramatically alter an individual’s emotional and behavioral profile over time.




## Leadership Workshop
In this workshop you will:

<Steps>

  <Step>
   determine your personal effectiveness in leading and inspiring others by completing a Life Styles Inventory™ (LSI). 
  </Step>
This tool helps you identify your thinking and behavioral patterns, providing insights to enhance your leadership abilities and foster positive change in your interactions with others.

  <Step>
  We will identify the specific behaviors and styles that will make you an outstanding leader.
  </Step>
  Such styles are related to many important outcomes such as: job performance, problem-solving effectiveness, quality of interpersonal relations, salary, individual health and well-being, and one’s impact on organizational culture.





</Steps>


To provide an even deeper understanding of your behavioral styles and opportunities for change you will invite feedback from others with the ILF system (Item-Level Feedback). These two systems together will provide critical information for your becoming an Outstanding Leader. As a result, you will be able to turn the organizational pyramid upside down by empowering others to exceptional performance while you drive meaningful change with a bottom-up-top-down strategy.
