## Summary

“Compassion in Action” continues the journey begun in my earlier book, Engaging the Heart for People, Performance, and Profit: Seven Competencies of Compassion@Work (2020). This sequel offers reflections from individuals devoted to making a difference in the world—people guided by “Spirit” and driven by “Service” not only in their personal and professional lives but in the lives of others. In a world marked by conflict—where division is amplified and the fumes of anger permeate our organizations, our roadways, and even our dining room tables—acts of kindness and compassion are more than ideals; they are necessities. These pages contain stories and insights that illuminate how compassion can cool the fires of discord and ignite hope. My desire is that these reflections will spark action and inspire readers to bring compassion into their own lives and the lives of others.
